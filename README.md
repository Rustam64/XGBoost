## About XGBoost

XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework and provides parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.

## Features

- Fast and scalable gradient boosting trees
- Support for regression, classification, and ranking tasks
- Efficient handling of missing data
- Built-in cross-validation and early stopping
- Parallel and distributed computing support
- Custom objective and evaluation functions

## Installation

To install the dependencies for this project, clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rustam64/XGBoost.git
cd XGBoost
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using Jupyter notebooks, you may also install Jupyter:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

Example usage of XGBoost in this repository:

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train XGBoost model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

You can find more examples and experiments in the [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) directory.
